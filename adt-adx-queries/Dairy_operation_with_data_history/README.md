## Graph updates walkthrough

This section is for use with the graph update queries in the *ContosoDairyDataHistoryGraphUpdatesQueries.kql* file.

This walkthrough assumes that you have set up data history connection that historizes twin property updates, twin lifecycle events, and relationship lifecycle events. Once youâ€™ve set up data history, use the [Azure Digital Twins Data Simulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-use-data-history#create-a-sample-graph) to automatically provision a twin graph of a dairy operation in your Azure Digital Twins instance. Be sure to select the **Dairy Facility** simulation type when generating the twin graph. Twin and relationship creation events will be generated and historized to your Azure Data Explorer database by this step.

Open [Azure Digital Twins Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer) and run the query _SELECT * FROM digitaltwins_ to visualize the twin graph. Make a note of the time, then wait a few minutes to establish an interval before you modify the twin graph. Then, delete several twins as shown in the red box in the figure below, by right-clicking on the twins and selecting **Delete twin(s)**. This will create twin/relationship deletion events.

Open the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/web-query-data), and click on the database that you selected when you created the data history connection.

Run the example KQL queries from the file *ContosoDairyDataHistoryGraphUpdatesQueries.kql* located in this GitHub folder.
